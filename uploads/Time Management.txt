Task : Learn Python

I have to define my goals which is learn Python and plan what i have to do to accomplish my goal.
First, I want to spare around 8 hour minimal a day to focus on learning Python. At this time, I can't really spend more
time focusing my learning to Python because of Bangkit assignment I need to do before the deadline, and also the course that
I need to watch and pratice. That way I will dicipline my self to learn Python at least 8 hour so I can keep at with it in the future
while I completing the Bangkit Python Course.
Sencondly, I will make this task my priority. So when I have to choose which course I would like to do, I'm looking for Python course
first since it is my priority.
Thirdly, when I'm learning Python, I'll try to keep focus on what I'm studying so it will not need more time to relearn because I'm
not understand enough. For me focusing isn't a problem since I got focused on something easily.
Fourth, I will plan my capability so I don't over-do myself with everything about Python. And because of Bangkit, I have to do multiple
course at the same time. So its important for me to save my capasity for the other course.
Last but not least, when obstacle come into my way on learning, I will look at my planning so I can feel inspire to continue. When we
talk about my agility, I would overcome the obstacle I face like when I'm can't do the task that should be done in Python, I always
have friends to help and I will try to ask help to them.
